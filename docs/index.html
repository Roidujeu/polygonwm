			<h2 id="first">What is PolygonWM?</h2>
				<p>PolygonWM is a window manager which supports windows which has  more than 4 sides. You can choose the shape you want - from pentagon to nonagon - from the list of available shapes.</p>
			<h2 id="sec">How is it different from all the other WMs?</h2>
			<p>As we have mentioned earlier, PolygonWM let's you have windows with different sides/shapes. The chances of you seeing something like that is rare. It doesn't claim to be better or faster or anything. It simply can do something which most other WMs can't - Polygonal Windows.</p>
			<h2 id="third">Why doesn't it have some features which other WMs have?</h2>
			<p>I strictly believe that software should be simple and efficient. The person who came up with the idea of PolygonWM is also a fan of software without bloat. Anyfeature which i believe is superfluous or unnecessary is removed/ignored. There might be some features which help making things easier, but then there's saying 'Worse is better'. We try to stick to this principle.</p>
			<h2 id="fourth">Is it free?</h2>
			<p>PolygonWM is not licensed yet, but it will soon be licensed. It is and always will be free. You can go through the <a href="https://github.com/Roidujeu/polygonwm" target="_blank">code </a>anytime you want.</p>
			<h2 id="fifth">But why?</h2>
			<p>There are some people who are obsessed with aesthetics. This project serves two purposes -satisfy the people who are looking for different aesthetics and answer the question "What if windows were non-rectangular?".</p>
			<h2 id="sixth">How do i get it?</h2>
			<p>There's no executable file for PolygonWM because it's compiled from source. Of course an executable can be made but then there's no point. The configurations are done before compilation and the executable's settings depend on the config.h file generated from the config.h.def file. In order to get it or to know more details, please visit it's<a href="https://github.com/Roidujeu/polygonwm" target="_blank"> GitHub page.</a></p>
